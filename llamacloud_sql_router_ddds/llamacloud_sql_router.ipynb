    "1. `chat()`: Appends the message to the chat history. This chat history is fed into the LLM, along with the given tools, and the LLM determines which tools to call. This returns a `GatherToolsEvent`.\n",
    "2. `dispatch_calls()`: Triggers a `ToolCallEvent` for each tool call given in the `GatherToolsEvent` using `send_event()`. Returns a `GatherEvent` with the number of tool calls.\n",
    "3. `call_tool()`: Calls an individual tool. This step will run multiple times if there is more than one tool call. This step calls the tool and appends the result as a chat message to the chat history. It returns a `ToolCallEventResult` with the result of the tool call.\n",
    "4. `gather()`: Gathers the results from all tool calls using `collect_events()`. Waits for all tool calls to finish, then feeds chat history (following all tool calls) into the LLM. Returns the response from the LLM."
